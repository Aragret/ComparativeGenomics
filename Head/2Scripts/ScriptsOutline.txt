=> Does divergence correlates with generation length?
=> Recombination is associates with divergence. We want to prove that recombination is associated with generation length
=> I've extracted branch lengths using tips number within tree structure(ape), then merged it with generation length data and correlated them. ComparativeGenomics/Head/2Scripts/BranchLengthVsGenerationLength.R (master)
=> Branch lengths negatively correlate with generation time of mammals species
=> Long-lived species are closer to each other than short-lived species are. 
=> future: other taxons ?
